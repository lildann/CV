I am an organised and creative full-stack Junior Developer. I love problem-solving and analysing traditional structures and formats to make them more efficient and productive. In November 2021 I graduated from [Makers Academy](#projects).

Before learning to code, I worked in the contemporary art world in galleries and museums in Berlin, New York and London. This career let me work with many different people on exciting large-scale projects, managing the delivery and organisation of ambitious exhibitions within hard deadlines. 

The bootcamp has enabled me to switch from a Facilitator to a Maker. Driven by curiosity, possibility, and a desire to keep learning, I am looking for a role where I can extend my programming knowledge and gain business development experience, while contributing to well-designed, useful tech that can make a difference to everyday life.
